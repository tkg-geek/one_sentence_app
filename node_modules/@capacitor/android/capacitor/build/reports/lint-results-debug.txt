/Users/keigotakeuchi/Documents/040_創業関連/G'sACADMY/個人開発/ONE SENTENCDE/03_iOS&Androidリリース用/one_sentence_app/node_modules/@capacitor/android/capacitor/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 6 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: DefaultLocale, Overdraw, Recycle, SetJavaScriptEnabled, StaticFieldLeak (2) [LintBaselineFixed]

   Explanation for issues of type "LintBaselineFixed":
   If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then
   the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been
   disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such
   that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather
   than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)

You should sanitize it before using it for creating a File. [UnsanitizedFilenameFromContentProvider]
        File file = new File(context.getFilesDir(), name);
                                                    ~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnsanitizedFilenameFromContentProvider":
     When communicating between applications with files, the server app can
   provide the client app with a maliciously constructed filename. The client
   app should never trust this filename and should either sanitize it or
   completely discard it.
